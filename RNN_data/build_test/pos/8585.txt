In 1594 in Brazil, the Tupinambas Indians are friends of the Frenches and their enemies are the Tupiniquins, friends of the Portugueses. A Frenchman (Arduno Colassanti) is captured by the Tupinambs, and in spite of his trial to convince them that he is French, they believe he is Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes their slave, and maritally lives with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhes). Later, he uses powder in the cannons that the Portuguese left behind to defeat the Tupiniquins in a battle. In order to celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat him."Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francs" is another great low budget movie of the great Brazilian director Nlson Pereira dos Santos. The screenplay is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi. The film is shot using natural light most of the time and is very realistic. The actors and actresses perform naked and Ana Maria Magalhes is magnificent, showing a wonderful body and giving a stunning performance. The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Z Rodrix. This movie shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by Europeans, focusing in the Portuguese and French at that time, trading with the Indians and exchanging combs and mirrors by our natural resources. This movie was awarded in the national festivals, such as the 1971 Brazilian Cinema Festival of Braslia (Festival de Brazlia do Cinema Brasileiro) with Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Dialog (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and Best Cenograph (Rgis Monteiro); Art Critics Association of So Paulo (Associao Paulista dos Crticos de Arte), with best Revelation of the Year (Ana Maria Magalhes) and some other prizes. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francs" ("How Tasty Was My Frenchman")
