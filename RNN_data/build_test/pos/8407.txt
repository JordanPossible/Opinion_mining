Life stinks is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. The black and the white always present in our lives. Mel Brooks performance is brilliant as always, and the other actors work is fine too. This movie has some Capra flavor, thats why is so good.There are some unforgettable gags such as the one when Brooks tries to earn some money dancing in the street, and all the people passing by just ignore him, or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes is Paul Getty and then start arguing and slapping each other.If you havent seen it, you dont know what youve missed.This movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich.The only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending, and reality hasnt.Yes indeed, Life Stinks.
