This one features an interesting way of handling a camera,espercially for a DTV movie - the version I saw was full-screen- but it falls short on the scenario department. First you getaround 20mn of talk, talk, talk in a would-be-hip, post-"Trainspotting" way, then it's slasher city. And then comesthe most dishonest cheat ending I've seen, much worse than"April Fool's Day" - where at least it made sense. So, all inall, it's the old song and dance : interesting director trieshard, but deserves better movie. Funny : usually, it is the actors which are in desperate need ofsomething betterÂ… Skip it anyway, for your time
