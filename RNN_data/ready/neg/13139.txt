New Orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in thisdebacle of a film. Quaid's attempt at speaking with a cajunaccent (by the way, hardly anyone speaks that way in NewOrleans) is terrible. Plot = elementary and mindless. Thispicture refers to itself as a mystery, but a mystery involves agradual process whereby a viewer is given clues and twists throughout a film. There's none of that here. "BigEasy" tries to get by on trite New Orleans stereotypes. Don't be fooled - the real Big Easy is nothing like the townthat Quaid & Barkin bumble their way through.
