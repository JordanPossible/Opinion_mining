I've just been at the cinema in down town Prague watching this film. Not due to the poster I found very Holywood old-fashioned heroicstyle. Not due to the high level starring which remind me that mostof those high starring French films are usually pathetic. But justbecause there are not so many films in my French mother tongue in acity like Prague. And because I love Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau'sCyrano. Then I decided to write up this small comment because I thinkI really don't agree with the comment main stream on this film on imdb.I was not disappointed. The film just look like the poster. Thecharacters are just as stupid as they look like. For a while Ithought Adjani would be like a caricature -- just a funny characteryou can laugh at. No she is not! For example when she decides to tellDepardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at thebeginning of the film then come the violins in a big fat patheticmusic which should make you cry and realize Adajani's character is adeeper person as she looks like. Maybe this was humor at the 10thlevel but I am sorry my sense of humor is not that high! If I want tosee some funny French film on the WWII I watch once again La GrandeVadrouille! It is definitively more fun! I have also read on imdbthat Lemoine is making a great performance in this film. I have tosay I have never seen a so bad acting! (Well I have never seen any EdWood's film). Nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of good(very costly) scenes like the one with the Pantheon in the morningwhen the German army arrives at Paris or when the refugees settle downon a bridge in Bordeaux. I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker butthat he does better with a good script. It was easy with Cyrano. Hehad not to write the dialogs!I give 1/10.
