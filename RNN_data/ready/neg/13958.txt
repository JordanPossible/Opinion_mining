The storyline seemed fine, the actors seemed fine, the movie shouldhave been fine. But it sure wasn't - It didn't lead us anywhere, thescenes are weird. Maybe it was meant to create something new, to makeus think. That atleast it did: Where is the rest of this film? To me itwas waste of money, time, and talent. Someone might want to see thisfor curiosity, to see if they can figure it out. Other I personallywouldn't recommend this to anyone.
