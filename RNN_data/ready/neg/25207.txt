This is without a doubt one of the worst movies EVER, I emphasize, EVER made. Whats worse, my old hero Dolph is in it and hes starring it. Jesus... The story is actually quite good but the way its carried out made even my body hurt. The fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter. The actors, except for Dolph who kinda sucks also, perform so badly you cant help but wonder if their reason for being there is that theyre all friends of the director, who by the way must have been absent most, if not all, of the time. This is 12 million spent in an unimaginable way, because by the look of the effects and scenery, the cost cant be a cent above 1000.
