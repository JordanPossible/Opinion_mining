This plot had more holes in it than an OJ Simpson alibi! I noticed two Star Trek references in the movie and, yet,ironically we have a lead character played by Andy Garciawho is the antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy of, "Theneeds of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one." Let's just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of San Francisco at incredible risk. Michael Keaton's character is almost asunrealistic as well. He neglects to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is angered when Garcia foils hisattempt to kill a bunch of cops at once. The child's doctor remains in charge of her faculties even after beenheld hostage several times in a short expanse of time butput her on a wide walkway 5 stories up and she loses it. Andy Garcia's child is something of an anathema in thismovie. He is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the movie's bright spots. He furthermore utters a line, that must have been the result of serendipity, regarding fighting cancer that parallels Keaton's motivation to escape. All in all, the movie was not acomplete waste (see From Dusk to Dawn 2: Texas Blood Moneyfor that) but disappointing considering the talent on hand.
