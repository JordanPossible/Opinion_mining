*** Possable spoiler but probably not ***The game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in itanymore! Diddy is gone aswell!The 1st Donkey Kong Country was one of my two all time favoriteSuper Nintendo games. (The other being Super Mario World)The 2nd Donkey Kong at least had diddy kong and good levels,although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times.However this one is the worst of the lot! It does not have the feel ofthe original or 2nd, The enemy's look stupid and the levels areeven worse. It does not look realistic anymore! I did not enjoy his game unlike the last two, the first had greatbackground music and the 2nd was not bad but the music in thisgame is horrible!It happens a lot these days that movies, shows and sometimesvideo games that start out fantastic, end up with it being ruined bya stupid sequel! I am sad to say I feel that donkey kong as a saga is not as goodnow that it has Donkey Kong 3!They should have left it at the original or MAYBE the 2nd one.
