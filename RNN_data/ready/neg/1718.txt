I've read all the comments on this film. I am a great admirerof the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book upon which thisfilm was based. The movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth. I do not criticize it foraltering small details or events for dramatic purposes; it isnot a documentary. But the script CHANGES the impact, reaction,realities, and changes in EVERY main character. It vastly altersthe real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman (which demeansthe culture of Tibet) to Harra's music box gift, to Harrar'schange of heart, everything about this movie is false - exceptfor the amazing photography. I understand that the shots of thePotala (the palace) were smuggled out of Tibet. However,changing a real story about the relationship between two people,one of them very important to this world, in order to build up amovie star is sad
