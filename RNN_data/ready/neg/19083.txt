In Bollywood it isn't rare that worthless films become hits, good films flopping and good actors not making it bigAKS is such a movieHimesh after a music director and singer tried acting Hell man, just because his songs became a hit that means next he becomes an actorThe producers were sure the film will work perhaps, the songs were a hit too and of course Himesh did his cheap publicity as usualThe film tells such a poor story, such poor direction, such poor acting it makes you cringeIndian rickshaws in Germany, Stunts by Himesh and lot of stupidity Himesh's cap is intact even when he is in the car which somersaultsDirection is poor Music is saving grace though most songs sound the sameHimesh tries hard but sadly his emotive scenes are a joke, lacks expressions, he is best suited for his music director and some singing He cuts a sorry picture Hansika is awful Malika is okay Sachin Khedekar is okay, Darshan Jhariwala hams
