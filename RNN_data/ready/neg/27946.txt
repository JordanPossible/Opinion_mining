Another trashy Grade Z quickie from the prolific Albert Pyun. Tim Thomersons 13 inch Clint Eastwood-like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head(!) to Earth and gets involved in a gang war in South Bronx! Mercifully short, but deadeningly dull, with the cheesiest effects since Attack of the 50Ft Woman. They should have fired the continuity guy, too: Note how Thomersons sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot. Laughably bad, but thats why we watch these movies, aint it? Sequel Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys is reportedly even worse, if thats possible.0 (of ****)
