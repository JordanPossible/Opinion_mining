I only watched this because it starred Josie Lawrence, who I knewfrom Whose Line is it Anyway?, the wacky British improvisationalcomedy show. I was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem. It is uplifting, touching, andromantic without being sappy or sentimental. The characters areall real people, with real foibles, fears and needs. See it.!
