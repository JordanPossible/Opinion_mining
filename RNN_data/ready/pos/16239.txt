Movie watchers often say great movies must have 3 memorablescenes to be considered truly great. Broadcast news doesn't havethree, it has twice that. This movie is extremely well written byJames Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never beenbetter. I love this movie for many reasons. It is great because itmakes you laugh and it makes you cry. Albert Brooks has severalgreat lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1(laughed) "I cansing and read, I am singing while I read," with Midnight Train toGeorgia playing in the background. # 2(laughed) Telling theWilliam Hurt character that "You really blew the lid off of nookie,"after watching Hurt's report on date-rape. #3 (Cried) When Aaron(A. Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and shecan't end up with Hurt's character because he representseverything about journalism Jayne finds dispicable. Finally, #4 (laughed) who can forget the scene where Aaronanchors the weekend news....hilarious. This movie should have won an Oscar! It has everything I love inmovies, great acting, intelligent script, and even a Jack Nicholsoncameo!
