Hotel du Nord  is the only Carn movie from the 1936-1946 era which has dialogs not written by Jacques Prvert,but by Henri Jeanson.Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet/Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers,Annabella/Aumont.The latter is rather bland ,and their story recalls oddly the Edith Piaf's song "les amants d'un jour",except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one.What's fascinating today is this popular little world ,the canal Saint-Martin settings.This movie is dear to the French movies buffs for another very special reason.The pimp Jouvet tells his protge Raymonde he wants a change of air(atmosphre) Because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosphre,the whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty)thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line,that is ,undeniably,the most famous of the whole French cinma:In French :"Atmosphre?Atmosphre?Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphre?" Translation attempt:"Atmosphere?atmosphere?Have I got an atmosphere face? This is our French "Nobody's perfect".
