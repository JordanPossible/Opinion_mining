MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD!!!How did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreadeddrivel? Robert DeNiro plays a Dumb Hollywood version of the standardviolence prone tough cop (i.e., he beats up the bad guys and rolls hiseyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book), and Eddie Murphy plays anot so tough cop who would rather be an actor (i.e., he screams out,"Freeze, police!" and has his "tough look" down pat). Naturally, theyare partnered when Bobby's loose cannon tactics get him in hot waterwith the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a"Cops"-like reality show. Take a breath, cuz that's as funny as itgets.No energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale retread ofevery copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with "15 Minutes" starring,yes, DeNiro himself as, pretty much the character he is playing here. The jokes fall flat, the action feels listless, and no one seems to behaving a good time. It's dead on the screen.Please don't waste your time. Even if you have an overwheming affinityfor one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor. Becauze if thismakes money, these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptablefor actors of their quality.And to Mr. DeNiro. You used to make serious films. I remember them -they were good. You were nominated for awards for them - remember howmuch fun that was? Now after "Analyze This" (which was good), "Meet theParents" (which was also good), and "The Adventures of Rocky andBullwinkle" (which was NOT good), I think we need to see you parodyingyourself less, and BEING yourself more. "Casino" feels like a long timeago. And no, I don't count "15 Minutes" as serious Bobby. Anyone whotook that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news
