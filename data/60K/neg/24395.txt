Yash Raj films are so funny, whatever works they follow it yet they are called the best production house?Seeing Bhatt films working they copied the formula, bikini and everything plus casting low actors like Uday and TanishaaThe film is so horrible it makes you cringethe jokes are so bad and horny it makes you slap them Uday resembles a gay plus a monkeyTanishaa resembles an idiot The director thinks we all are idiots Arjun Sablok takes the audience for granted Music is saving grace Camera-work is goodUday Chopra hams like an idiot, Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g if Kajol was annoying der then Tanishaa is worse the rest are okay
