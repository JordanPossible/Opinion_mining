I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur-productions. And Meat Market 2 starts really promising with a nice homage to Fulcis Classic "Zombi".So I leaned back and waited to be impressed. Okay, some of the makeups are great for such a no budget movie and some actors (the vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but else theres nothing.I didnt expect a new Romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value. The director sure knows how to stage body rippings and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) its time to learn something more.In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with bore - for me thats not enough - sorry.** out of *****
