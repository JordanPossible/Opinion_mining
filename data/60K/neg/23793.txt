This television show, is a idiotic waste of time if you want to learnabout animals watch the discovery channel. If you want to watchnincompoops on television just watch MTV. MTV stands for music televisionnot nitwit D-listers preforming retarded skits or bratty kids cryingtheir hearts out for not getting a BMW for there 16th birthday. I betthat if you like this show I bet you love viva la Bam, and jackass huh? I think my IQ dropped ten points watching this show. This is a combination of two shows jackass and the animal planetSome people think this is a good combination.I on the other hand think it is retardant.And if you notice its a lot like jackassand viva la Bamjust a note, this show is horrible
