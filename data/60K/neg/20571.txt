L'Humanité is a murder mystery. These movies tend to be popular,and the 6.9 rating it currently has suggests that it has been, too.Unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.A few non-spoilers, for instance, include a 5-minute scenewherein the main character eats an apple. And another 3 minuteswhere he breathes.In case you were wondering, this is not, in fact, art. Neither is it acommentary on humanity, which from the title it seems it is tryingto be. It is, in fact, boring. There are numerous attempts in thismovie to say something about humanity. One might think toonesself, "How would I comment on humanity?" And the mostobvious and boring answers will of course be sex, love, and death.Not that these options are uninteresting when done well - just thatthey are the canonical options. For sex, this movie does its best tomake it unattractive and disgusting. In your first five minutes -hence this is not a spoiler - you will see the bloodied vagina of amurdered 11-year-old girl; it's a murder mystery, remember? Lateron, a few people throw themselves at each other and have whatthe director would like us to believe is "raw" sex, but in reality it'scontrived and overly symbolic - but worse yet, uninterestingly so.I enjoy being disturbed by movies. This movie showed me why:Disturbing movies usually show something inside of someone,their humanity, which they did not know existed and are a bitscared of. L'Humanité tried to do just this and failed, and I walkedout of the theatre not disturbed, but disgusted, thinking that I hadwasted my time in the theater, despite having seen the movie forfree.
