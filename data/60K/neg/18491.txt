K Murli Mohan Rao made the much better BANDHAN in 1998 This film is an awful remake of THE WEDDING SINGERBasically in short, the film consists of: Salman Khan who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenesJackie Shroff- wasted, bored and tired, his role is so stupid He is shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer?Inder Kumar- confusing characterization againRani Mukherjee- boring, overweight and does nothing special Pooja Bhatra- tall, fair and actress worthy but lacks talentKashmira Shah- says a dial as if a poetryMohinish Behl- poor fellow the 2 kids were awful tooThe story is the same and has awful comic scenes, a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track of Shakti KapoorDirection is poor Music is decentSalman khan just goes through the motions, Jackie is bad, Rani is as usual, Pooja is bad, Mohinish and Kashmira are nothing great Inder is awful
