Anupam Kher is an excellent actor, he debuted at 28 playing a 50 yr old in SARAANSHNow he turns director with OJJThe film has a good plot but it's regressiveThe theme has been done to death and Urmila's character looks too put on while Anil-Mahima and Abhi- Tara tracks are too sudden and then forgottenThe film moves a snail pace and begins to drag but there are several good scenes like the entire conflict between Anil-Fardeen and Abhishek where Fardeen says to sell the houseAbhishek getting caught for a crime and Anil shouting at himThe climax is too much thoughDirectorally Anupam shows potential, but has some way to go Music is okayAnil Kapoor excels in his part like always Fardeen tries hard and is okay but needs to improve Abhishek is excellent, this was a turning pt, people realized he can act Urmila is okay Mahima and Tara are wasted Waheeda is good
