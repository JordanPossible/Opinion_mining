Most action films are crass of Hindi cinema, especially of Sunny and his family The film is typical Sunny type with bashes, big dialogues and melodramaThe film also has typical Rajiv Rai ingredients of many henchmen and a weird villainThe starting is okay and then the shift to Kenya is good but then the film goes on and on The sequence of events move at a slow pace and nothing that great happensThey are many stupid scenes like the Kenya policemen are shown like jokers especially SharatThe climax too is prolongedRajiv Rai does an okay job Music is okay, only 1 song works and that is the last TOOFAN Camera-work is goodSunny Deol is as usual, Chunky acts like a monkey while his serious scenes are laughable, Naseer is alright heroines are pure wood Amrish Puri is not even half as scary as he was in TRIDEV the rest are okay
