I have to say that I really liked UNDER SIEGE and HARD TO KILL.watching Seagal doing his funny martial arts on people. I havebeen always looking forward to Seagal-Movies and, unfortunately, I was first disappointed by GLIMMER MAN, which I found really bad. THE FOREIGNER is probably one of the worst Seagal has everacted in. Horribly boring, badly edited, wrongest soundtrack and so on! Dear reader, do yourself a favor an stay away from this!Honestly: Stay away!
