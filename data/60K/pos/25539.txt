Spaced Invaders is one of the funniest movies, Ive ever seen. I dont understand, why this movie didnt get better critics, its funny, harmless and sweet. I first watched it, when I was 11, and I really fell in love with it... 2 days later, I got it on VHS :-P Till today, Ive shown it to many friends, and they all liked it, but nobody knew the movie before. I think, thats the problem, nearly nobody knows it, so nearly nobody can like it... This movie never got a real chance, thats sad, "SI" has really the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc." or "Spaceballs". Ok, enough displeasure - What I really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to laugh your head off, watch it! Even if you dont get mad about it, its worth watching! --> Prepare to laugh, earth scum!
