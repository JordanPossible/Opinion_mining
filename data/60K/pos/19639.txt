**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing "à la fac" when you know they don't speak French? Wouldn'tyou use a more common word like "université"? I lived in France for a while and I sort of do know and understandEurope (and I love it), but my (German) roommate and I found thispretty insulting overall. It looked like a movie funded by theEuropean Parliament, and it tried too hard basically. It had allsorts of differences that it tried to tie together (not a bad thing initself) but the result is at best awkward, but in fact ridiculous--toomany clashes that wouldn't really happen. Then the end of themovie--the last 10 minutes--ruined all the rest. Why doesn't Xaviertalk to the Erasmus students he meets back in Paris? Why doeshe just walk off? Why does he just run away from his job, is that"freedom"? And in the end, is the new Europe supposed to rest ona bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day? Is this whatit's made up of? Besides, the acting was pretty horrible. I can't believe JudithGodrèche's role and acting. Why was she made to look likeEmanuelle Béart so much? At first I thought Xavier was OK butwith retrospect I think he was pretty bad. And that's all really too bad, because technically (opening credits,scenes when he's asking what papers he needs) it was reallygood (except for sound editing around the British siblings), and thesoundtrack was great too. So the form was good, but the contentpretty horrible.
