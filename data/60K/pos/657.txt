The best Treasure Island ever made. They just don't make filmslike this anymore, or ever. No one makes films like this. Morethan a novelty, this film is funny, frank and fascinating, yet moody,mysterious and morose. This is one of my favorite pictures. Thedirector must have had some idea what it is all about, but hecertainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations, while leaving little left to the imagination. Why hehas not made more films like this, I have no idea. Whilereminding me of some of the best noir, it is one of a kind. But thisis not for the lazy or simple.
