Cinematically, this film stinks. So does a lot of the acting. But Idon't care. If there is a strong representation of what the 80's werelike(For a lot of us in the innercity anyways) and what hip-hop, Zulunation, and break dancing were really like.Great music, greatdancing! It almost seems like a documentary of a time now pastwhen hip-hop was a way of life. It's also interesting to see NewYork looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack. Some viewersmay be too young to remember that It was a poor, run down cityduring the 70's and 80's. This is the best of all the hip-hop/breakdancing movies that came out around that period. Of course the80's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows andmovies, but those of us who lived through it will always rememberit fondly for a time when music, dancing, and graffiti were fresh, yo!
