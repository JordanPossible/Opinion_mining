BABY FACE is a fast paced, wise cracking, knowing smirk of a film thatlasts only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh what a smart 75 minutes theyare! That a story that covers so much ground could be told in such ashort time puts most of today's movie makers to shame. Screenwriters oftoday should study the economy of BABY FACE and cut the bloat thatoverwhelms so many of their films. The story is no nonsense. An amoral woman rises to wealth first under,and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her.Sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming, happy ending,but it isn't hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted togo, so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is terrific as is George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as ahapless suitor. Not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one. Ifyou've never seen BABY FACE catch it the next time it's shown on cableor rent the cassette. It's worth the effort..
