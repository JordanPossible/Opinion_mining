When seeing this movie you should take notice to that its not a normal movie. It has no real story just characters, a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can just lay back and listen. The movie stands out thats why its hard to find a right way of describing it.Thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed.I for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one-liners and things that differ from the "normal". You cant really put the finger on whats so wonderful about it its just a comical world where gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. A movie that you can see more than one time.
